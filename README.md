# Project Title: EduHelp – A higher study help portal

<h1> 1.	Introduction </h1>

A background review of the state of the art in the relevant field
As more and more students aim to pursue higher education in their respective fields, a growing number of them are planning to attend universities abroad. This is the combined result of the blurring international boundaries, advancement in information technology as well as the economic prosperity that the country achieved significantly in the last decade

The problem addressed in the project:
For a majority of us, studying at a reputable university abroad is the imminent goal. While planning to study abroad, most of us don’t know what to look for and where, and can’t decide accordingly on their next moves. Not all applicants will be successful in their very first attempt. Some might get admitted, but no scholarship. Some will face visa issues. Thus, it is important for one to remember that it is a lengthy process and starting the process sooner will result in a greater chance of success. While applications often have multiple stage deadlines, early applications are often considered more for scholarships and funding than late ones. As there are no such websites where we can find all information together so maximum applicants submit incomplete information and get rejection for several times 

Objective of the proposed projects:
As increasing number of students plan to go abroad for studies, there remains numerous questions-the answers which could pave the way to a better and informed decision. Our aim to create a website “Study Abroad Guide” which will include all related information at one place and to decrease the hassle of the students. Our website will provide the information of:

•	University list (Canada and Australia as of now)
•	University ranking (Fetched from some reputed ranking sites like The Times Higher Education, QS ranking, etc.)
•	International Students required documents (Both for application and Visa)
•	Portal for student to store information
•	Personal statement
•	Academic/Professional references
•	Education and living cost (country wise)
•	Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Statement Of Purpose (SOP) Templates
•	Scholarship opportunitiesbased on the university
•	Job opportunity on or around campus


The adopted approach

There are millions of students who lack behind or fail to get into their desired universities due to lack of information. There’s also a huge amount of businesses running who profit off students by perusing them to get into a certain university because of the commission they will receive. The student who doesn’t have enough knowledge put their trust on such education consultancy firms rather know as medias in our country and get deceived. 
There are multiple websites who provide such information but most are country based and fail to provide the updated information. 
Our solution will minimize the hassle of the students and provide them with a new and interactive portal where they can easily surf through various university informations and decide for themselves which suite them better. There will be no middle man, thus the student will be able to decide on their own which subject is best and follow their dream.

2.	Literature Review / Existing Projects

Similar projects have been found online, website like https://www.educations.com/who is the global online meeting point for students and schools in over 210 countries. Here, prospective students can quickly and easily find relevant information on study abroad options, while schools and higher education institutions can market themselves effectively to the right audience. Then there is https://www.studyabroad.com/which is owned by EducationDynamics, a privately held corporation that operates an education and media online business. It is the Internet's leading source of information on educational opportunities for students to study in other countries. It is a comprehensive directory of study abroad programs, including summer study abroad, internship, service learning and volunteer abroad programs, high school study abroad, intensive language programs and more, all organized by subject or country or city. International education support through our study abroad handbook provides a guide to education abroad, health and safety and study abroad scholarship/financial aid information.  
Websites like, https://my.uni-assist.de/ and https://application.uonbi.ac.ke/ are university based websites which provides a portal for students to submit their documents and update their information.
Keeping these projects in mind our solution tries to bring both these facilities under one portal. Our objective is to, not only provide students with best choice of universities but also help them throughout the process. We will provide portals to store their personal statement, CV and most necessary documents in order to edit or view at any time, from anywhere. 

3.	Business viability of the project

Novelty: In this project we will create a website from which students will get help for higher studies. Students can login with their name and pass and then they will be able to see all the information related to studying in abroad. They do not have to visit different websites for different types of information. They can be able to see all of the information in our website. For ex: Suppose someone wants to go to Canada and he/she wants to take admission in a University called “X”. Then he/she just need to put the name of that University in our website. Then he/she can be able to see all of the information and requirements of that University(like- How much minimum Cgpa needed for admitting, How much will be the total costs etc.).

Market Segment: This website will be a part of the market. Because many students in our country have the desire to go abroad for higher education. Every day thousands of students search the internet about various universities. Which university would be best for them, which would be less costly, which would be best for their respective subjects / departments etc. So I think if we create that kind of website it will be a part of the market. Many students will search their desired things in our website and they will be benefitted for sure.

Competitor analysis: We know business will always have competition. And if we don’t know what that competition is up to, you could be missing out on huge opportunities. That’s why a competitive analysis is so crucial to our success as a business. It gives us the tools to quickly adapt to any changes in the competitive landscape and potentially capitalize on industry trends that our competitors haven’t even noticed.
I think our project will become a part of the competition. Because our project will be somewhat exceptional. Because there is no project/apps like ours on the internet, people will absolutely use our app to find their queries.
Competitive advantages of the project: As I said there aren't many apps like ours on the internet, so people will definitely use our apps, in which case we will definitely benefit.
Success Factors: We know success factor of a project depends on :
•	Strategic Focus (Leadership, Management, Planning): We have plans to complete the project on time. And we already decided what the requirements were and what we would use in our project. People (Personnel, Staff, Learning, Development)
•	Operations (Processes, Work): We have already shared our tasks among the group members and we will discuss the process step by step in a few days.
•	Marketing (Customer Relations, Sales, Responsiveness): People will use our app definitely.
•	Finances (Assets, Facilities, Equipment): I think we will not face any problem financially. Because our project is simple and we don't have to use many tools to create our project. Basically since we are using API (Application Programming Interface), we just need to buy it, not more than I think.

Risk factor: 
•	 The main thing that comes to mind when we talk about risk factors is cost but for our website, I don't think we will have any cost issues.
•	Schedule risk, the risk that activities will take longer than expected.
•	Non friendly user interface.
•	Website not optimized.
•	Cache optimization.
4.	Project analysis 

Major Components of the project:
Our project is a web and app based project which will require understanding of back end work, front end work and also app based work. Our web based work can be divided into the following categories:
•	Purpose & Clarity
•	User-Focused (UX based)
•	Navigation (UI Interface)
•	Appearance (For both web and app)
•	Ease of Updates and Content Management
•	SEO & Analytics

Target for 499A and 499B:
	499A:
The website will be designed from scratch using python, php, html, CSS, JavaScript and Django framework. We will have a domain registered and a web hosting site to host our website. We plan to user docker containers, so that our work can be divided into multiple sections and the whole website doesn’t get disrupted from each other’s various use of programming language. For the implementation of docker we will use Kubernetes. The database design and manual collection of data will all be completed. We plan to use a web crawler to minimize our work. We plan to have a running website with all the mentioned features by the end of the course. 
499B:
The mobile app will be developed in this course. We will develop the android mobile application for our desired project using Android studio. We will use CodeLab as a guide and create an user  friendly app with compatibility on multiple android versions. The database created for the website will be linked to the app.
Cost analysis : we have some costing on having domain, price range is due to the website size, complexity, chosen tech stack, and selected IT vendor.

In most cases, it is hard to understand the website price based only on its layout.
Additional expenses influencing website cost [domain name, hosting, SSL, marketing]
Visual info summary about website development cost via infographics. 
There is a specific cost on designing Simple website cost ranges from $200 to $1,500
Website with custom design costs around $1,500 – $5,000
Website with custom design and features need a $5,000 – $10,000 investment
Ongoing website development and marketing activities could cost anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 per month. 
Tech stack, development approach, the number of features, backend architecture complexity, etcare the reason of cost on web based application.
